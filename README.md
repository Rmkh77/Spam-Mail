# Email Spam Detection using ML
Spam Mail: Spam email is unsolicited and unwanted junk email sent out in bulk to an indiscriminate recipient list.
To classify mails a Machine Learning model is build.
In this Project, 4 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm that best classifies the mails into Spam and Non-Spam
Those algorithms are :
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
SVM
after training the model using these algorithms, among these 4 SVM showed more accuracy of 0.98
Hence SVM is used for prediction of new mail.
